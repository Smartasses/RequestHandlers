RequestHandlers is a framework that helps you structure your code into small, easy-to-test units of work.

When you are writing an MVC-application, your controllers sometimes get cluttered with too much actions and code. If you use the classes and conventions given to you by RequestHandlers, your code will be more testable and comprehensable.

This project is a core project used by the other RequestHandlers-projects we provide. You can use this to build RequestHandlers for your own specific case, but if you are building a ASP.NET Web API or ASP.NET MVC Core web application, you can use the following packages.

 - [RequestHandlers.Mvc](https://github.com/Smartasses/RequestHandlers.Mvc) - ASP.NET Core
 - [RequestHandlers.WebApi](https://github.com/Smartasses/RequestHandlers.WebApi) - ASP.NET Web API
